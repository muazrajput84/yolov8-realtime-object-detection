#🎯 YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection

Author:** M. Muaz  
Role:** AI/ML Engineer  
Environment:** Conda (Python 3.10)  
Frameworks:** PyTorch, OpenCV, Ultralytics, NumPy  

#🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates a **real-time object detection system** built using **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** — a state-of-the-art object detection architecture.  
The system can identify and label multiple objects directly from your **webcam feed** with high speed and accuracy.

This project is ideal for portfolios showcasing:
- Computer Vision skills  
- Deep Learning and PyTorch knowledge  
- Real-time image processing and AI pipeline development  

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Real-time object detection using webcam  
✅ Bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores  
✅ Screenshot capture of detections (`S` key)  
✅ Optimized for both CPU and GPU environments  
✅ Modular and easy to extend for custom datasets  
✅ Fully open-source and free to use  

## 🖼️ Detectable Objects

The YOLOv8 model (trained on **COCO dataset**) detects **80+ object categories**, including:
- 👨 Person  
- 🚗 Car  
- 🚲 Bicycle  
- 🐕 Dog  
- 🐈 Cat  
- 🧳 Backpack  
- 🚦 Traffic light  
- 🏠 Chair, TV, Laptop, etc.  

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local system using **Conda**:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
